# Run

The solutions for everyday will read input from stdin and output result to stdout.

For output, the $i$-th line ($1 \le i \le 2$) contain the $i$-th result.

Racket and Julia both have heavy bootstrap time. The solution itself also output the time
the actual function spend.

## Racket

```bash
racket ./racket/day01.rkt < ./input/day01.txt
```

## Julia

```bash
julia ./julia/day01.jl < ./input/day01.txt
```
